Crowdfund is a Ruby program developed based on Pragmatic Studio's Ruby Programming hands-on video course, and distributed as a Ruby gem.

This program has been developed using all the strengths of Ruby including the following.

Ruby Programming Environment
* Installing Ruby on your favorite operating system (free exercise)
* Running Ruby using the interactive Ruby shell (irb) and writing Ruby program files
* Using Ruby's documentation system to get help
* Installing external Ruby libraries using RubyGems
* Troubleshooting common problems

Ruby Language Constructs
* Expressions and variables
* Numbers, string, and symbols (free video & exercise)
* Loops and conditional expressions
* Arrays and hashes (free video & exercise on hashes)
* Classes, modules, and structs

Object-Oriented Programming
* Using built-in Ruby classes
* Defining your own classes with state and behavior (free video & exercise)
* Creating unique objects
* Telling objects what to do by calling methods
* Modeling class-level inheritance relationships
* Sharing code with mixins

Object-Oriented Design Principles
* Encapsulation
* Separation of concerns
* Polymorphism
* Don't Repeat Yourself
* Tell, Don't Ask

Blocks and Iterators
* Calling built-in methods that take blocks
* Writing your own methods that yield to blocks
